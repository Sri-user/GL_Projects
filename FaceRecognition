Dataset contains 10.770 images for 100 people. All images are taken from 'Pinterest' and aligned using dlib library.

Analyzed,cleansed and visualised the images
Created an embedding for each image, mapping face features as a vector representation. Later an euclidean distance method is employed to calculate the distance and predict how similar a test image is to the trained image
Created a training and test data from the images and scaled these images using Standard Scaler from scikit learn
Features from embedding were analysed using PCA to find the cumulative variance and reduced the number of features which would explain more than 95 percent of the variance in each image
Implemented SVM classifier on the already trained VGG Face to predict/recognize the test image
Achieved a 96 percent accuracy of recognizing faces
